# PerFail 2022 (Under Construction)
This workshop aims to emphasize sharing negative results, lessons learned, and experiences of failed experiments in the area of pervasive computing. As a negative result, we consider studies run correctly (in the light of the current state of the art) and in good practice, but fail in terms of proof of the hypothesis or come up with no significance. The badness of the work can also come out as a properly but unfittingly designed data collection, an unconvincing evaluation, simulation, or measurements. When presenting the negative results and lessons learned, we aim to prevent other researchers working on similar problems to avoid certain pitfalls and avoid wasting time and energy on approaches that do not lead to fruitful results. We welcome papers that are not only honest with their “negative” results but also highlight possible steps that should be taken to avoid future failures. Overall, the workshop will provide researchers studying all areas of pervasive computing important insights in risks due to research methodology design choices.

- Workshop date: TBD

## Submission Guidelines

Papers should contain research and scholarly work describing original, previously unpublished work, which is not currently under review by another workshop, conference, or journal. Submissions must be made via EDAS.

Regular papers should present novel perspectives within the scope of one of the two tracks of the workshop. Papers must be in PDF format (6 pages maximum). Papers in excess of page limits will not be considered for review or publication. PerIoT is single-blind. All papers must be typeset in double-column IEEE format using 10pt fonts on US letter paper, with all fonts embedded. The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the IEEE Computer Society website (available here: [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html))

PerFail will be held in conjunction with IEEE PERCOM 2022. All accepted papers will be included in the PERCOM proceedings and published by the IEEE. Workshop papers will be included and indexed in the IEEE digital libraries (Xplore).

Submission link: TBD

## Registration

Each accepted workshop paper requires a full PerCom registration (no registration is available for workshops only); otherwise, the paper will be withdrawn from publication. The authors of all accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop. Papers not presented at the workshop will be considered as a "no-show" and it will not be included in the proceedings.
